About
=======================================

A simple Mongo sharding (with replica sets) setup example using Mongo/Java/Ant.

See: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sharding and http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replica+Sets

Prerequisites
=======================================

You must have Ant installed and in your $PATH.

You must have Mongo installed and the bin files in your $PATH.

Running
=======================================

Open six terminal windows and run one command in each:

ant mongo-shard-0

ant mongo-shard-0a

ant mongo-shard-1

ant mongo-shard-1a

ant mongo-config

ant mongos

This runs two shard servers (four if you include the replicas), a config and mongos server(s).

The ports are:

    * mongo-shard-0  : 27018
    * mongo-shard-0a : 27019 (this is a replica of mongo-shard-0)
    * mongo-shard-1  : 27020
    * mongo-shard-1a : 27021 (this is a replica of mongo-shard-1)
    * mongo-config   : 27022
    * mongos         : 27017

In another terminal run:

ant run

This command will initialize your replica sets, shard cluster and run a couple of simple tests. This command
takes a while to run because it waits (sleeps) to make sure the replica sets and cluster are setup.

Note: If you run "ant clean" this deletes the temp database files stored in build/*.

Note: This was written/tested with 1.7.5-pre- (2011-01-04 - nightly build).
