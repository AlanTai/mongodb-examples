About
=======================================

A simple Mongo sharding setup example using Mongo/Java/Ant.

See: http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sharding

Prerequisites
=======================================

You must have Ant installed and in your $PATH.

You must have Mongo installed and the bin files in your $PATH.

Running
=======================================

Open four terminal windows and run one command in each:

ant mongo-shard-0

ant mongo-shard-1

ant mongo-config

ant mongos

This runs two shard servers, a config and mongos server(s). The ports (in order) are 27018, 27019, 27020 and  27017.

In another terminal run:

ant run

This command will initialize your shard cluster set and run a couple of simple tests. This command 
takes a while to run because it waits (sleeps) to make sure the cluster is setup.

Note: If you run "ant clean" this deletes the temp database files stored in build/*.

Note: This was written/tested with 1.7.5-pre- (2011-01-04 - nightly build).
